	\section{Introduction}
	The scope of this project is to implement a convolutional neural network to 
	classify the images in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
	
	First of all, the original training set has been shuffled and divided into 
	train and validation sets, with $49000$ and $1000$ images respectively.
	
	A certain preprocessing has been applied to the data, in particular, the 
	pixel values, initially comprised between 0 and 255, have been rescaled 
	between 0 and 1 and some binary assignment matrices have been created to 
	represent the class assignments, which were integers between 0 and 9. 
	
	The architecture of the convolutional neural network follow the 
	instructions provided, as well as the hyper-parameter values.
	In the training phase, different batches were used, containing different 
	examples for each epoch.
	
	\section{Once per epoch, document the classification accuracy on the 
	validation set. The final accuracy should be close to 70\%.}
	
	\section{document the evolution of the validation accuracy with dropout}
	
	\section{hyperparameter settings}

	\section{compute the test set accuracy and document the result.}
